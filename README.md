# Predictive-Maintenance-Project

# I tried to build a project to a machine failure (binary) and type (multiclass) and for that I used a dataset called 'Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification' from kaggle.
# This dataset consists of 10 000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns
