# Predictive-Maintenance-Project

I tried to build a project to a machine failure (binary) and type (multiclass) and for that I used a dataset called 'Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification' from kaggle.
This dataset consists of 10 000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns.

I used various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest. Further I used SMOTE and ensemble methods to improve the model.
